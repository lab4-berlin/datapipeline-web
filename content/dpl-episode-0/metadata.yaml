  In the very first episode of Data PipeLINE, Ilya lights up his pipe and unpacks the hype (and the reality) around data mesh. 
  Once a buzzword on every job ad, the concept promised to fix bottlenecks by decentralizing data teams. But what went wrong? Why did so many implementations fail? Ilya explores the four core principles of data mesh, shares real-world stories, and explains why the real challenge isn’t technology it’s people. 
  If you’re thinking about data mesh, this episode might save you some trouble.

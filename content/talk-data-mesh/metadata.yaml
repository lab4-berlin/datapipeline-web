  Ilya's keynote speech at the Thoughtworks event "Scaling Data & AI Products: Strategy, Execution & Governance" on the 20th of March 2025
  Most Data Mesh initiatives fail not because of technology, but because of people. In this talk, I explore how communication, ownership, and trust are the real drivers of success. 
  Drawing lessons from Agile, DevOps, QA, and hiring, I challenge common misconceptions and hype. We look beyond tools and architectures to understand why decentralization without cultural readiness won’t help,and what to do instead. 
  If you’re thinking about implementing Data Mesh, start here: with people, not platforms.
